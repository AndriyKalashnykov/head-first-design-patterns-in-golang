# head-first-design-patterns-in-golang

A descriptive series on the design patterns based on the O’Reily book of the same name adapted to Golang from Java

# What’s so special about design patterns?
You know you don’t want to reinvent the wheel (or worse, a flat tire), so you look to design patterns — the lessons learned by those who’ve faced the same software design problems. With design patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others, so that you can create functional, elegant, reusable, and flexible software. You’ll learn :
- The patterns that matter
- When to use them, and why
- How to apply them to your own designs
- When not to use them (how to avoid pattern fever)
- OO design principles on which patterns are based
